GPT? Visual intro to transformers - Chapter 5, Deep Learning

GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer

First word: Generative, bots that generate new text or events (like math, pictures, text…etc)

Second word: Pre-trained, refers to how a model went through a process of a massive a lot of data, with room to learn from a given context

Third word: Transformer, a specific kind of neural network, a machine learning model, and the core invention underlying the boom in AI

The original transformer was introduced in 2017 by Google was use to translate text from one language into another.


There are numerous internet protocols used in computer networks:

	•	TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
	•	SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
	•	FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
	•	ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
	•	BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
	•	DNS (Domain Name System)
	•	DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and HTTP/HTTPS serve different purposes but share similarities. RPC allows a computer program to cause a procedure to execute on another address space, usually on a different computer. HTTP/HTTPS, on the other hand, are protocols primarily used for communication on the web to transfer data between a client and a server. Both RPC and HTTP/HTTPS involve remote communication but differ in their underlying mechanisms and use cases.
